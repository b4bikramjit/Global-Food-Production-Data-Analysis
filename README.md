# Global Food Production Data Analysis

This project aims to explore and analyze the global production of various food items across different countries over the span of 6 deacades. The dataset encompasses a comprehensive record of the production quantities of essential food items like maize, rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables, and other agricultural products.



## Objective
The primary objectives of this analysis are:

Identifying Trends: Explore how the production of different food items has evolved over the years on a global scale.

Comparing Nations: Compare the production levels of specific food items across different countries.

Highlighting Significance: Identify significant changes or anomalies in food production trends and their potential impacts.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes data on production quantities of various food items, organized by country and year, spanning from 1961 to 2023.
## Tools and Techniques
Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Analysis Techniques: Data cleaning, manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and potentially time series forecasting.
## Project Structure 
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and engineering features for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, patterns, and correlations in food production.

Comparative Analysis: Comparing production levels between countries and regions.

Insights and Conclusion: Summarizing key findings and implications drawn from the analysis.
